## Security Considerations

| Aspect                           | RadiusX Light Chat Client - V1                            | RadiusX Light Chat Client - V4                                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Key Protection**     | Server-side: API keys never exposed to client             | Client-side: Requires proxy server to protect API keys                |
| **Request Authentication** | Handled securely on server                                | Can be exposed if not using proxy                                     |
| **Data Processing**        | Can perform server-side processing before/after API calls | Limited to client-side processing                                     |
| **Compliance**             | Better suited for enterprise security requirements        | Better suited for simple deployments with lower security requirements |
