Based on the codebase context provided, I can see:

1. GitHub Actions workflows:
   - `deploy.yml` - Main deployment workflow
   - `cleanup.yml` - For cleaning up resources when branches are deleted

2. The `bin.sh` script which contains the deployment logic that:
   - Validates CloudFormation templates
   - Deploys a CloudFormation stack for CodeBuild
   - Starts the CodeBuild project
   - Monitors deployment progress
   - Gets outputs (like Frontend URL)

3. The `deploy.yml` CloudFormation template that sets up the CodeBuild project

4. Various CodeBuild constructs in the CDK code:
   - `ApiPublishCodebuild`
   - `BedrockCustomBotCodebuild`

Let me create a presentation script that explains this CI/CD implementation, focusing on:

1. The overall CI/CD architecture
2. How GitHub Actions integrates with AWS CodeBuild
3. The deployment process flow
4. Benefits of this approach
5. Key features of the implementation

# CI/CD Implementation Presentation Script for Scrum Meeting

## Introduction

"Good morning team! Today I'd like to walk you through the CI/CD implementation we've set up for our Bedrock ChatBot project. This implementation automates our deployment process and ensures consistent deployments across environments."

## Architecture Overview

"Let me start with the high-level architecture:

1. We use GitHub Actions as our CI/CD orchestrator
2. The workflow triggers AWS CodeBuild for the actual deployment
3. AWS CloudFormation manages our infrastructure as code
4. The process handles everything from code validation to deployment monitoring"

## How It Works

"Here's the flow of our CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Trigger**: The pipeline is triggered on:
   - Push to our main branch
   - Pull requests to main
   - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch

2. **Setup Phase**:
   - GitHub Actions configures AWS credentials
   - Sets up Node.js environment
   - Validates CloudFormation template

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Deploys our `deploy.yml` CloudFormation stack
   - This stack creates a CodeBuild project with the necessary IAM roles
   - The CloudFormation stack passes parameters like region settings, repo URL, etc.

4. **Build Phase**:
   - CodeBuild clones our repository
   - Applies configuration overrides based on parameters
   - Executes the CDK deployment process
   - Monitors until completion

5. **Feedback Phase**:
   - Retrieves the Frontend URL from logs
   - For PRs, comments with deployment status"

## Key Features

"Some key features of our implementation:

- **Parameter Customization**: We can customize deployments with parameters like:
  - Self-registration settings
  - Lambda SnapStart configuration
  - IP range restrictions
  - Allowed email domains for sign-up
  - Bedrock region settings

- **JSON Override**: We support advanced customization via JSON overrides that get merged with the CDK configuration

- **Security Focus**:
  - Proper IAM role configuration
  - IP address restrictions
  - Resource cleanup when branches are deleted

- **Monitoring and Feedback**:
  - Real-time monitoring of deployment progress
  - Automatic failure detection
  - Deployment URLs provided in PR comments"

## Demo

"I can show you a real example of a recent deployment from our GitHub Actions logs, where you can see the full flow from trigger to successful deployment with the frontend URL."

## Benefits

"The benefits of this approach include:

1. **Consistency**: Every deployment follows the same process
2. **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required
3. **Visibility**: Clear logs and status updates throughout the process
4. **Flexibility**: Supports different deployment configurations
5. **Security**: Proper IAM roles and permissions management"

## Next Steps

"For future improvements, we're considering:

1. Adding more comprehensive testing before deployment
2. Implementing a staging environment
3. Setting up notifications for deployment status
4. Adding performance metrics collection"

## Questions

"Any questions about our CI/CD implementation?"
